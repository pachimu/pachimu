### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Valentina, I'm currently in my last year of PhD in Cognitive Science and trying to gradually transition to Data Science (or find a Data Scientist position **within** Cognitive Science, that would be a dream come true!) <br>
<br>
I'm working on a couple of non-profit/pet projects and still in the process of assembling my Data Science portfolio. Right now you can look at projects I completed during the 9-month-long Data Science Specialist course at Yandex.Practicum. I'm especially happy with the Steelworks and Gamedev projects. Steelworks because it was the final one and I could use all of my new arsenal there and Gamedev because I've been part-timing as a Linguist in Game Localization during my PhD (so for the last 5 years!) and so this field is very close to my heart. 

I work mostly in **Python** and **R** <br> 
*(if you'd like to see examples of my code in R they are here but in a private repository as they are related to copyrighted stuff and also a little spaghettiesh)* <br>
<br>
Here is my arsenal:<br>

- Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- R: Datatable, Dplyr, Ggplot2, Tidyr
- SQL basics
<br>
I'm not looking for a full time job but I'd be very happy to collaborate on something non-profit, especially related to social, psychological or behavioural research. <br>
<br>
And of course if you happen to have a postdoc position available I'm very interested :)<br>
<br>
Here are my major first-authored publications: <br>
